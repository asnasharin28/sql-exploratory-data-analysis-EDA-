# 📄 **Sales Data — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project performs a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on cleaned sales, customer, and product datasets extracted from the **Gold Layer** of a Data Warehouse.

The goal is to understand data patterns, business performance, customer demographics, and product behavior using structured SQL queries.

---

## 📁 **Dataset Description**
The following datasets are used for analysis (exported as CSV files):

- **`fact_sales.csv`** — transaction-level sales data  
- **`dim_customers.csv`** — customer demographics and location  
- **`dim_products.csv`** — product hierarchy, category, and cost  

These datasets originate from a complete ETL process (**Bronze → Silver → Gold**).

## 🎯 **Objectives**
- Analyze sales trends and KPIs  
- Understand customer distribution  
- Explore product categories and performance  
- Identify top and weak-performing items  
- Validate the structure of the Gold Layer datasets  
- Build BI-ready summary metrics

## 🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**
- **SQL Server**
- **Window Functions**
- **Aggregations & Joins**
- **Gold Layer Views**
